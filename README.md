# RSA_Signature_with_Compression

This is example interactive script to demonstrate the RSA signature algorithm but compression of the plaintext is applied before computing the RSA signature.

The plain text is encoded to numbers: a=00 b=01 c=02 d=03....
Then compression is applied to the encoded number set.
